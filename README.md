# Integrated Academic Insights Portal (IAIP)

The Integrated Academic Insights Portal (IAIP) is a full–stack academic management and analytics system developed as a DBMS project. It provides an end-to-end solution for managing academic data such as students, faculty, departments, courses, attendance, assessments, final results, and semester-wise GPA.

The system is built using:
- MySQL (15-table normalized schema)
- Flask (REST API backend)
- React + TypeScript (Vite frontend)

IAIP replaces manual Excel-based processes with a structured, scalable, and data-driven digital portal.

## Overview

IAIP centralizes all core academic workflows into one unified platform. It manages:

- Student and faculty information  
- Department and course structures  
- Semester-wise course offerings  
- Student enrollments  
- Subject-wise attendance tracking  
- Internal and external assessments  
- Final results and grade computation  
- GPA analytics and performance trends  

The platform follows a clean three-tier architecture with separation between frontend, backend, and database layers.
